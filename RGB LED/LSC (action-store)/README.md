Captured IR-Signals from IR-Remote for LED Stuff from Action 


Action is a store that sells low budged tech and other stuff in europe

This IR-Remote I found in the basement, maybe someone have a use for the IR Files. 
Before the Remote goes to recycling center, I saved all their funtions. 
Maybe for someone who does reverse engineering or some skids trolling with bruce or flipper.
